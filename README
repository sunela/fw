Sunela Firmware
===============

This repository contains the Sunela firmware. Both a version that runs on the
real hardware and a simulator ("sim") that runs under Linux, using SDL, are
built.

Most of the firmware is distributed under the terms of the MIT License. See
COPYING for more details.


WARNING
-------

This firmware is under development and not yet intended for real-life use !
Among other issues, test coverage is very poor, some code needs major
cleanup, and "secrets" are not hidden at all.


Prerequisites
-------------

The following packages are needed (the package names given here are for
Ubuntu 22.04):

fontconfig		Font configuration utility fc-list
fonts-liberation	Liberation fonts
jq			Command-line JSON processor
libgcrypt20-dev		GNU Crypto library
libsdl2-dev		Simple Directmedia Layer (SDL2)
otf2bdf			OpenType/TrueType BDF converter otf2bdf
python3-nacl		PyNaCl


Running the simulator
---------------------

Install the packages listed in the previous section. Then run

make fonts sim

(if you have set up the RISC-V toolchain, below, then you can also just run
"make", which will build the simulator and a binary for the M1s Dock.)

Start the simulator with

./sim

Press the space button to activate the simulated device. Then use the
mouse to operate the user interface. The following operations are
generally available:

- click to press user interface buttons, select items from lists, etc.
- many pages have an overlay with additional functions. These overlays
  can be invoked by clicking and holding.
- clicking and left-swiping usually returns to the previous page.
- click and drag up and down to scroll.
- [S] takes a screenshot and stores it in a PNG file
- [Q] leaves the simulator


Running on the Sipeed M1s Dock
------------------------------

We run the Sunela firmware on the M0 (RV32) core of the Bouffalo BL808. The
Bouffalo SDK provides the USB stack.

Prerequisites:

We need a riscv64-unknown-elf toolchain with T-Head extensions. The RISC-V
toolchain in Ubuntu (gcc-riscv64-unknown-elf) lacks these extensions.

Toolchain with T-Head extensions:
git clone https://github.com/bouffalolab/toolchain_gcc_t-head_linux

Bouffalo SDK (for BL616, BL618, BL808, and others):
git clone https://github.com/bouffalolab/bouffalo_sdk.git

Check out the Bouffalo SDK and the toolchain at the same level as the fw/
directory, i.e.,
/some/place/fw/
/some/place/bouffalo_sdk/
/some/place/toolchain_gcc_t-head_linux/

Important: add the toolchain to your PATH:
PATH=$PATH:/some/place/toolchain_gcc_t-head_linux/bin

If you have also installed the riscv64-unknown-elf from Ubuntu, you need to
put the toolchain with T-Head extensions first, e.g.,
PATH=/some/place/toolchain_gcc_t-head_linux/bin:$PATH

Build:

make fonts sdk

Transfer to on-board Flash:

If the left USB port ("OTG") is connect to anything, disconnect it.
Connect the right USB port ("UART") to the PC from which you will flash.
If the serial console (e.g., picocom) is connected, disconnect it (e.g., with
^A^Q).

If the USB-serial device of the M0 core is at /dev/ttyACM1, just run

make flash

If the device is elsewhere, use

make flash COMX=/dev/ttyelsewhere

To test the code:

- Connect the right USB port of the M1s to a PC, for power and, optionally, the
  serial console:

  picocom -b 2000000 /dev/ttyACM1
  or
  make picocom

- reset the M1s by pressing the RST button (under the board)

- Connect the left USB port of the M1s to a PC
  Note: USB power of both ports of the M1s Dock is directly connected to the
  board's VBUS rail. If connected to different PCs, power can flow from one,
  through the M1s, to the other.

The device should now enumerate as "Qi Hardware Sunela BL808" (20b7:ae72).
